description: '<p><B>The first book by distinguished novelist, journalist, and literary
  critic Rebecca West: a biography of Henry James</B><p><BR />Setting the standard
  for a century''s worth of criticism, Rebecca West diagnosed Henry James as an American
  who "could never feel at home until he was in exile" in this slim, readable biography,
  published just a few months after his death in 1916.<p><BR />West boldly assesses
  <I>Roderick Hudson</I> as "not a good book," and displays remarkable foresight in
  describing <I>Daisy Miller</I> as a "sad and lovely" book that "will strike each
  new generation afresh." An early advocate of feminist principles, she has fascinating
  things to say about James''s heroines, and her division of his work into early and
  late periods continues to be a basic principle of Jamesian scholarship.<p><BR />One
  of the twentieth century''s brightest minds, Rebecca West began her career as a
  public intellectual with this thoughtful and compelling study of a literary giant.
